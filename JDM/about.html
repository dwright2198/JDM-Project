<h2> <p> <center> JDM was founded July of 2018, and is based out of Charlotte, NC. JDM is a trusted hub that helps find different apparel accommodated to them! It can be accessed online or from a mobile phone or tablet.

JDM is an app that first begins with an style quiz, the style quiz gives us an idea of what you like to wear and what you don't. It gives us a better understanding of your personal style! JDM allows you to either take a picture of yourself or manually enter your sizes into the system. You can enter your size information one of 2 ways. The first way is by taking a full body picture of yourself and sending it in or, you can manually enter your sizes. This website is nothing like anything out here because not only does it save your sizes for you, it pulls up all the websites that have your sizes available.</center>
